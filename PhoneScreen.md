# Tell me about yourself

Certainly, I hold a Bachelor's degree in computer Science and have spent the last five years working in software development. I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, from frontend to backend and Devops in my previous role at previous job. With my past work experience, I am confident in my problem-solving skills,learning skills and believe that I can quickly make a contribution in my new job.

当然，我拥有计算机科学学士学位，过去五年一直从事软件开发工作。在之前的职位中，我有机会参与各种项目，从前端到后端，以及 DevOps。凭借过去的工作经验，我对自己的解决问题能力和学习能力充满信心，并相信自己能够在新工作中迅速做出贡献。

# Why did you leave your last job?

The main reason I left my last job was because my partner was coming to Adelaide to study for a PhD and she needed my company. On the other hand, I thought this was an opportunity for me to see the wider world and enrich my experience.

我离开上一份工作主要原因是因为我伴侣要来阿德莱德攻读博士学位，她必须有我的陪伴。另一方面我觉得有这个机会我可以看看外面更广阔的世界，丰富自己的阅历。

# Why do you want to work here?
My last job was software development. I was very good at it and I thought I really enjoyed it. I have experience in javascript, react, nextjs, devops, aws. I think this role is a good match for my experience. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and be part of a dynamic team.

我上一份工作是软件开发。我非常擅长这个，而且我觉得自己非常喜欢这份工作。我拥有 JavaScript、React、NextJS、DevOps 和 AWS 方面的经验。我认为这份工作与我的经验非常匹配。我很高兴有机会贡献我的技能，并成为一个充满活力的团队的一员。

# what is your plan in the next five years

In the next five years, I’ve got two goals.

First, since I’ve moved to Australia, I really want to improve my English — not just reading and writing, but speaking fluently and naturally, like a native speaker. I’ve been practicing every day and I’m getting better.

Second, on the career side — in my last job, I mostly focused on delivering tasks as a developer. In the future, I want to take on more responsibility, not just writing code but also leading features, proposing ideas, and helping guide the team. I’d love to grow into a role where I can make a bigger impact — both technically and by mentoring others.

未来五年，我有两个目标。

首先，自从搬到澳大利亚后，我非常想提高我的英语水平——不仅仅是阅读和写作，还要能流利自然地说话，就像母语人士一样。我每天都在练习，而且进步很快。

其次，在职业发展方面——我上一份工作主要专注于以开发者的身份交付任务。未来，我希望承担更多责任，不仅仅是编写代码，还要领导功能开发、提出想法，并帮助指导团队。我希望能够成长为一个能够发挥更大影响力的职位——无论是在技术方面，还是在指导他人方面。

# what is your visa status

I hold a 500 dependent visa. Since the main applicant is a PhD, I can work full-time without any restrictions on working hours, and my visa lasts until 2030. After that, I can apply for a work visa for another 3 years, So I don't need the company to support me with visa issues. 

我持有500陪读签，由于主申是PHD，所以我可以从事全职工作，没有工作时间的限制，并且我的签证持续到2030年


# What are your salary expectations for the job

I’m more interested in finding a position that’s a good fit for my skills and interests. I’m confident that you’re offering a salary that’s competitive in the current market.

Well, according to my research and past experience, my understanding is that one hundred thousand dollars per year is typical based on the role and requirements.

我更感兴趣的是找到一个适合我技能和兴趣的职位。我相信贵公司提供的薪资在当前市场中具有竞争力。

嗯，根据我的研究和过往经验，根据职位和要求，我的理解是，年薪十万美元比较常见。

# what's your greatest strength?
I’d say my greatest strength is my ability to adapt and learn quickly. For example, I originally trained as a Java developer, but when my team needed someone to take on front-end work, I stepped up and quickly learned modern front-end technologies like React and Next.js. I was able to deliver production features and eventually became the go-to person for front-end development.

I also applied this mindset in my personal life — I left a stable job in China to come to Australia and explore a completely new environment. I believe this willingness to learn, take risks, and step out of my comfort zone is what helps me grow both as a developer and as a team member.

我认为我最大的优势在于适应能力和快速学习的能力。例如，我最初接受的是 Java 开发人员培训，但当我的团队需要有人负责前端工作时，我便挺身而出，快速学习了 React 和 Next.js 等现代前端技术。我能够交付生产级功能，并最终成为前端开发的可靠专家。

我也将这种心态运用到我的个人生活中——我辞去了中国一份稳定的工作，来到澳大利亚，探索一个全新的环境。我相信，这种乐于学习、敢于冒险、勇于走出舒适区的品质，帮助我作为一名开发者和团队成员不断成长。

# What is your greatest weakness

I’d say my greatest weakness is that sometimes I overthink how to express things in English, especially during fast conversations or meetings. Since English is not my first language, I used to worry about speaking perfectly.

But as a developer, I need to read English documents, write code, and listen to English tutorials frequently, so I have no problem with English reading and writing and professional direction.

I still actively working on this — I’ve started joining English meetups, watching more tech talks, and practicing every day to improve my fluency and confidence. It’s already getting better, and I’m becoming more comfortable sharing ideas in team discussions.

我最大的缺点是有时会过度思考如何用英语表达，尤其是在快速对话或会议中。由于英语不是我的母语，我以前总是担心自己的英语表达是否完美。

但作为一名开发者，我需要经常阅读英文文档、编写代码和听英文教程，所以我的英语读写和专业方向都没什么问题。

但我仍在积极努力——我开始参加英语聚会，观看更多技术讲座，并每天练习以提高我的英语流利程度和自信心。我的英语水平已经有所提高，在团队讨论中分享想法也变得更加得心应手。
