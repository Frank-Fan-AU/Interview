I passed AWS test and get AWS Certified Developer certification"



# Tell me about yourself

Thanks for your inviting, I hold a bachelor’s degree in computer science and hold the AWS certification, I have spent the last five years in software development. With my past work experience, In Frontend I have a strong ability to build responsive and user-friendly front-end interfaces with React or Vue, In Backend I can build scalable APIs and backend services with node.js or Java. I also have experience in MySQL and MongoDB, In DevOps, I have experience in implementing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

# Tell me more about your company? is it a startup or what?


# Why did you leave your last job?

The main reason I left my last job was because my partner was coming to Adelaide to study for a PhD and she needed my accompany. On the other hand, I thought this was an opportunity for me to see the wider world and enrich my experience. So I quit my job. and I hope to find another developer job here, because I enjoy being a developer. Having a job will also help me better integrate(融入) into the local life and culture.

# Why do you want to work here?
My last job was software developers. I was very good at it and I thought I really enjoyed it. I have experience in javascript, react, nextjs, devops, aws. I think this role is a good match for my experience. I’ve noticed that your company embraces cultural diversity. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and be part of a dynamic team.

我上一份工作是软件开发。我非常擅长这个，而且我觉得自己非常喜欢这份工作。我拥有 JavaScript、React、NextJS、DevOps 和 AWS 方面的经验。我认为这份工作与我的经验非常匹配。我很高兴有机会贡献我的技能，并成为一个充满活力的团队的一员。

# what is your plan in the next five years

As my wife will be studying here, I plan to work in Australia for at least the next five years. If I have the opportunity to join your team, I believe that—combined with my development experience—I can be a stable and continuously contributing team member. By then, I may also apply for permanent residency to stay in Australia longer.

由于妻子要在这边读书的原因，未来五年我都会在这里工作，如果我能加入你们，相信加上我的开发经验，我会是一个非常稳定且能不断做出贡献的员工，也许到那时我会申请pr来更长时间的留在澳洲

# what is your visa status

I hold temperary visa without restiction, so I can do a full-time job, My visa is a subclass 500. However, since my wife—the primary applicant—is study for PhD, there are no work hour restrictions on my visa.

I am listed as her dependent (secondary applicant).


# What are your salary expectations for the job

I’m more interested in finding a position that’s a good fit for my skills and interests just like the positon I submit. I’m confident that you’re offering a salary that’s competitive in the current market.

Well, according to my research and past experience, my understanding is that eighty thousand dollars per year is typical based on the role and requirements.


# what's your greatest strength?
I’d say my greatest strength is my ability to adapt and learn quickly. For example, I originally trained as a Java developer, but when my team needed someone to take on front-end work, I stepped up and quickly learned modern front-end technologies like React and Next.js. I was able to deliver production features and eventually became the go-to person for front-end development.

I also applied this mindset in my personal life — I left a stable job in China to come to Australia and explore a completely new environment. I believe this willingness to learn, take risks, and step out of my comfort zone is what helps me grow both as a developer and as a team member.


# What is your greatest weakness

I’d say my greatest weakness is that sometimes I overthink how to express things in English, especially during fast conversations or meetings. Since English is not my first language, I used to worry about speaking perfectly.

But as a developer, I need to read English documents, write code, and listen to English tutorials frequently, so I have no problem with English reading and writing and professional direction.

I still actively working on this — I’ve started joining English meetups, watching more tech talks, and practicing every day to improve my fluency and confidence. It’s already getting better, and I’m becoming more comfortable sharing ideas in team discussions.

我最大的缺点是有时会过度思考如何用英语表达，尤其是在快速对话或会议中。由于英语不是我的母语，我以前总是担心自己的英语表达是否完美。

但作为一名开发者，我需要经常阅读英文文档、编写代码和听英文教程，所以我的英语读写和专业方向都没什么问题。

但我仍在积极努力——我开始参加英语聚会，观看更多技术讲座，并每天练习以提高我的英语流利程度和自信心。我的英语水平已经有所提高，在团队讨论中分享想法也变得更加得心应手。

# can you give me a summary of your work experience?你上分工作主要干啥

I worked as a Frontend Developer at China Sports Lottery Technology Co., where I was mainly responsible for the frontend development of the company’s monitoring systems. During this time, I built responsive, intuitive, and user-friendly monitoring tools and data visualization dashboards for operations teams, significantly improving system usability and efficiency. I also optimized and refactored several legacy projects, resulting in noticeably faster page load times and overall performance improvements.

I also used G6, a graph visualization library, to display cluster status and alerts in a topological structure, which greatly reduced the time needed for operations staff to identify and troubleshoot issues.

In addition, I developed backend APIs for internal tools using Java and participated in setting up the company’s CI/CD pipelines, helping to enhance automation in deployment processes.

我曾在中体彩科技公司担任前端开发工程师，主要负责公司监控业务的前端开发工作。期间，我为运维人员开发了响应及时、数据直观、交互友好的监控工具和可视化大屏界面，提升了系统的可用性和效率。同时，对部分旧项目进行了优化和重构，显著提高了页面加载速度和整体响应性能。

我还是用G6，一种拓扑结构来展示集群状态及告警，极大程度上减少了运维人员排查故障的时间

此外，我还使用 Java 为部分内部工具编写后端接口，并参与了公司持续集成和持续部署（CI/CD）流水线的搭建工作，助力提升开发与部署的自动化水平。
