# What is your looking for moving forward really?（你在找啥工作）

I’m looking for a full-stack development role.


# Are you more front end? More back end? what's your background?（偏前端还是后端）

I’m stronger on the front end, but I’ve also worked on the back end for about four years. So I do both.

# How would you rate your?（自我技术能力评价）

I’d rate my front-end skills as strong — I’ve worked with React, Next.js, and Tailwind extensively. For back-end, I can handle common tasks like building APIs using Express.js and working with PostgreSQL, but I’m still working on more advanced backend patterns.


# what type of salary are you looking for?（期望薪资）

Well, according to my research and past experience, my understanding is that one hundred thousand dollars per year is typical based on the role and requirements.

# visa type（签证状态）

I hold a 500 dependent visa. Since the main applicant is a PhD, I can work full-time without any restrictions on working hours, and my visa lasts until 2030. After that, I can apply for a work visa for another 3 years, So I don't need the company to support me with visa issues.
