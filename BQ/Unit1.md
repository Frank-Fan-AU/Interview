# can you give an example of a time you overcame a challenge at work?

Sure. In my first year on the job, there was a major change in our team — we suddenly needed someone to take over all the front-end work. At that time, I primarily worked on back-end development, but I volunteered to take on the challenge.

It wasn’t easy — I had to continue maintaining our existing Java/Spring Boot back-end services while quickly learning front-end technologies like React. On top of that, I had to deliver new front-end features on time.

I managed my time well, learned quickly, and successfully completed several key front-end tasks. In the end, I not only filled the gap, but also grew into a dedicated front-end developer — and that experience really shaped my full-stack capability.

当然。在我入职的第一年，团队发生了重大变动——我们突然需要有人接手所有前端工作。当时我主要负责后端开发，但我自愿接受了这个挑战。

这并不容易——我必须继续维护现有的 Java/Spring Boot 后端服务，同时快速学习 React 等前端技术。最重要的是，我还必须按时交付新的前端功能。

我很好地管理了时间，快速学习，并成功完成了几项关键的前端任务。最终，我不仅填补了空缺，还成长为一名专注的前端开发人员——这段经历真正塑造了我的全栈能力。
